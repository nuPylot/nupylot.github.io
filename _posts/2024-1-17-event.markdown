> Monitoring, analysis, and optimization of robotic operations and activities in various settings, such as manufacturing floors, warehouses, agricultural fields, and healthcare facilities. Leveraging Business Intelligence (BI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) analytics, this approach provides real-time insights and predictive capabilities that significantly enhance the performance, safety, and efficiency of robotic systems.

## Features
To create a reference platform for the following:
- Real-Time Monitoring and Data Collection: Robotic systems generate vast amounts of data from various sensors, including visual, audio, and environmental data. Real-time monitoring involves collecting this data continuously to ensure that robots operate optimally and safely. Sensors track various parameters like position, speed, temperature, battery status, and more, providing a comprehensive picture of each robot's current state. 

- Business Intelligence (BI) Integration: BI tools play a crucial role in visualizing the data generated by robots. With BI dashboards, users can monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as uptime, error rates, maintenance schedules, and task completion times. BI tools also enable decision-makers to filter and slice data, customize reports, and gain a deeper understanding of operational efficiencies and potential bottlenecks
- Event Detection and Response Automation: Robot event management systems can automatically detect anomalies or specific events—such as unexpected obstacles, component malfunctions, or deviations from programmed behavior. Using AI models, these systems can trigger pre-defined responses, like rerouting a robot, issuing maintenance alerts, or shutting down to prevent accidents
- Customizable and Scalable Solutions: Robot event management platforms can be customized to suit different industries and operational needs. Whether it’s managing a fleet of agricultural drones, warehouse automation robots, or healthcare assistance robots, the platform can scale to handle increasing numbers of robots, data points, and operational complexity.
